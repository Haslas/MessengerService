Local Area Network Messenger Service
Messenger service between computers developed in year 11 Computing GCSE.
Created by Daniel Fernandes.

The software uses three python programs: Inbox, Outbox, and Server.
It hasn't been updated since, please don't think that this is a good representation of the programmer's programming ability.
